### こと

`The activity, the fact, of my having been to Japan in the past exists.` (Cần phân biệt chút là từ "đi" kia là ở quá khứ, không phải *non-past*, nên để ám chỉ việc "đã đến Nhật").
In other words, we're saying `I sometimes go to Japan / going to Japan is a fact that exists`. If we say `どんな人にも失敗することがある`, we're saying `everybody sometimes makes mistakes / whatever kind of person it may be, the fact of making mistakes exists` (Ở đây dùng *non-past*, để ám chỉ điều này đang/sẽ/có thể xảy ra?).
You might go into one of those Penguin Cafés where the waiters and waitresses are all penguins and you may see a sign saying `ペンギンをくすぐらないこと` and that means `Don't tickle the penguins`. And the reason it's marked with `こと` is because this is a rule of the establishment. If you go into that café, you are duty bound not to tickle the penguins, ever, however tempting it may be, because it's a `こと`.
And what is a `こと`? In this case it's a decision which also means a rule or a regulation (Hiểu đúng hơn là `こと` -- `a decided thing`).

Một cái nữa chúng ta có (Ở bài 73): `あなたのことが好きだ` is fairly understandable if it were just `あなたが好きだ` (`I like you`), but actually what we're saying is that I like your `こと`. Nghĩa là:  `I like things about you` or `I like the thing about you`.

#### どういうこと, そういうこと & ということ
- `どういうこと` is one that we often hear. It means, in a way, `what kind of こと?`
- `そういうことでした` (`So that's how the situation was explained`).
- Now, `そういうこと` or `どういうこと` doesn't have to be something particularly recondite or difficult, but it tends to imply a greater depth of needed explanation than a simple `どんな`.
- `そんなこと`: we have some kind of a negative reaction to it.
### もの
If we say `冬は寒いものだ`, what we're saying is "winter is cold, and that's just a thing, that's a thing, you have to come to terms with it". Someone says `Ooh, it's cold` and you say `冬は寒いものだ` -- `winter IS cold / winter's a cold thing`.
we may say `希望のあるところには必ず試練があるものだ`, and what we're saying there is `Where there's hope, there's always a test`, a test here meaning something we have to overcome, something we have to do in order to attain that hope.
> It doesn't make logical sense, but what you're doing is making that statement and then emphasizing it and also putting a particular kind of stress on it by saying `ものだ` – `that's just how it is, it's a thing, that's something we have to understand, that's something we have to get used to, it's something that doesn't change, it's something that's inevitable`: `ものだ` – `it's a thing`.

The `ものだ` we've just discussed has to be in the present tense because we're talking about generalization, and the present tense, as we know, isn't really a present tense.

What's the difference between saying `東京に行ったものだ` and `東京に行ったことがある`?

- The `ことがある` is simply a literal statement: `The fact of my having been to Tokyo exists.`
- `東京に行ったものだ` is in English like saying `I used to go to Tokyo` and it has much more emotional weight. It's like saying `This is a thing I used to do, this is something that used to happen`
