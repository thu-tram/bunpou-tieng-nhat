Nhiều lắm nhưng liệt kê qua thì có: かい、だい,、ぜ、ぞ、さ、から、し、ちょうだい
`よ` or `ね` or `よね`
### かい
Về cơ bản là か (`かい` is simply a softened and colloquial form of `か`), nghe hơi *rough* chút (Theo kinh nghiệm Immersion của tui thì thường có nam giới mới dùng かい thôi):
Ví dụ: 
- 「まあ、そういうことなら、おじさんがダミアンに話をつけてやろう」
- 「そ、そんなことができるの**かい**？」
- 「出来るぞ。おじさんは、こういう奴らとの話し合いが得意なんだ！」

> Some sources say it's primarily masculine and that's kind of half-way true. You don't hear many younger female speakers using it, but you do sometimes hear older female speakers using it.

### だい (& どうだい)
`かい` also has a partner, which is `だい`. **`だい` is really `だ` plus `かい`.**
Không hiểu lắm về cách dùng, ý là mang tính để hỏi? Hay là đóng vai trò như だ nhưng nghe nam tính?
> And just about everything I've said about `かい` also applies to `だい`,  **except** that there is a particular collocation, `どうだい`, which is much more widely used. So, if somebody's eating something and you say `どうだい?` -- `what's it like? / how is it?` -- and they might say `おいしい/美味しい!`

### ちょうだい
Có nghĩa kiểu ください nhưng chủ yếu là kiểu mà nữ giới mới dùng (Đi với thể て)
人聞きの悪いことを言わない_で__ちょうだい_。
### ぜ、ぞ、さ
Now, `ぜ` and `ぞ` are very simple. They're just verbal exclamation marks which lend a little force to whatever it is you're saying (**They're quite rough and really are masculine speech**and they're the sort of thing you'll probably see more in anime and manga than you will in real life)
`さ` is similar but it's not nearly so rough. **It's much more widely used**
> **It's important not to confuse `さ`, the emphasis-lending sentence-ender,****to `さあ`, which comes at the beginning of a sentence and is more of a pause-for-thought kind of expression.**

### から
Mang giọng giải thích, nhẹ nhàng (hoặc ngược lại, damn.. tùy vào *giọng*). Ví dụ: `自転車に乗るのは禁止ですから` [polite tone] = `It's forbidden to ride a bicycle around here` (but by adding the `から` to the end of it, they're kind of softening it, turning it into an explanation for you).
Conversely, they might say `自転車に乗るのは禁止ですから` [stern tone], and that has a different implication. There, the `禁止` is being rammed home all the harder for that `から`.

### し
Khác với から, nó ám chỉ không chỉ một lý do, mà còn nhiều lý do khác nữa
> `さくらが来ないし帰ります` and this time we've put in the most important part, the real reason for our leaving, but by saying `し` rather than `から` we're also saying `Because Sakura isn't coming (and for other reasons) I'm leaving.` **What this does is take the pressure off Sakura.** Although she may be the main reason, we're diffusing it a bit by suggesting that there are also other reasons
