### Rule 1
The first rule of Japanese word order is: **The Engine always goes at the end of the sentence.**

### Rule 2
The second rule: **Anything that modifies any-THING must go before it**.
If we say `いちばで _(zeroが)_ 青いドレスを買った`, we're saying `I bought a blue dress at the market.`

### Chia nhỏ câu
In an `A does B` sentence, the nouns marked by the main logical particles other than が, that is, by を, に, で, and へ, are all modifiers for the verb.
But the main verb-sentence logical particles, を, に, で, and へ, do one thing and one thing only. **They modify the verb; they tell us more about it.**
