わけ、そういうわけ、わけが分からない、わけない
`わけ` is a noun
### Các ví dụ bằng Tiếng Anh
If I say “Sakura was out in the rain, and therefore she’s wet”, we are taking two known facts and stating the causal, the reasoning, connection between the two.
If I say “Sakura is wet and therefore I reason that she was out in the rain”, we’re taking exactly the same piece of reason, the same causality, and working in the other direction. 

We’re working from one known fact to another unknown fact that we use the reasoning to arrive at. But that piece of reasoning, that causal link, that fundamental underlying reasonality, is the same in both statements. In one case we’re working it forward, in the other case we’re working it backward, but that fundamental underlying causal logical reasonality, to coin a phrase, is the same. 

(Hai câu trên về cơ bản là giống nhau, kiểu như cùng một đồng xu, nhưng lúc thì mặt ngửa, lúc thì mặt úp, nhưng về cơ bản thì vẫn là một đồng xu đấy)
### Reasonality
So “わけ”, as we see, expresses a cause, a reason, and a conclusion or a logical judgement – all of those things.
Đọc nghĩa Tiếng Nhật đi: どうしてそう△なる（である）かという事情・理由。
### そういうわけ
- **そういうわけでベッドの下に隠れた** – By so-said reasonality I hid under the bed
- `そういうわけでした` -- `so that's how it happened`.
- `そんなわけで宿題を忘れました` – _By such a reasonality I forgot my homework_
### わけ as “It’s not as if…” / “It’s not that” / “It doesn’t mean that…”

We take sentence A and then we’re saying that sentence B conclusion can’t be drawn from it. Kiểu không thể đưa ra kết luận từ A được:

“お金が足りない (Money-is-insufficient) わけ (reasonality) ではない (is-not)”
“it isn’t that she’s short of money” 

### わけが分からない / 訳が分からない
it's meaningless, it's nonsense (Hay hiểu một cách nghĩa đen hơn là 訳 (Reasonality đấy) が 分からない (Không rõ ràng, the most literal sense of the word, `do broken down / do analyzed`))
### わけない / 訳ない (訳がない)

“わけがない" hoặc gọn hơn là “わけない”. Phủ nhận sự tồn tại của một cái gì đó.

“x わけではない” Cái gì đó mình đang nói về thì "không phải cái わけ đấy". This is the simple difference between “ではない” and “がない”

We’re saying that no reasoning exists. “わけがない”: “there is no reasoning”. And therefore, since there is no reasoning, since it doesn’t compute, it can’t be the case.

VD: “さくらはウソをつくわけがない” – Sakura-tell-a-lie reasonality is non-existent
“Sakura wouldn’t tell a lie” – there’s no way she’d tell a lie.
### わけがない as `there is no reason`
`そんなにお金の要るわけがない`= `there's no reason she would need that much money`

Cũng có thể có nghĩa là "game là dễ": `日本語を話すのはわけがないことだ` -- `Speaking Japanese is easy, no problem` (`わけがない` here? What we're saying is that there's really no reasoning needed).
