# たら

Cách tạo thể này: form a verb or an adjective into its -た/-だ past form (this is the only conditional that can be used about past events)
`家に帰ったらさくらがいた,` we're saying `When I returned to the house, Sakura was there`
Ở đây たら nhấn mạnh vào cái "điều gì đã xảy ra khi điều kiện được đáp ứng" còn -ば/れば, which throws more stress on the question of whether or not the condition will be fulfilled or even the fact that it wasn't fulfilled.

Most of the conditionals are interchangeable in many cases, but if we're talking about a condition which we're fully expecting to be fulfilled, we're really saying more `when` than `if`, we're most likely to use -たら.

We sometimes use the forms -ったら and -ってば with a small っ before them **to indicate exasperation**. So we might say `さくらったら` or `さくらってば`.
For example, we might say `もう言ったってば`, which is `I've already said that, haven't I?`

LƯU Ý: The context in which たら is used can often imply that B follows causally from A, but たら in itself doesn't necessarily carry that implication. You will find plenty o sentences where A does not cause B and たら is used..
