Now, these are `開く`, `開ける`, `開く`, `開ける`. When we look at these at first they look like two self-move/other-move pairs, don't they? And up to a point they are.
The second thing we notice is that when you write them with kanji, you can't actually see the difference between `あく/あける` and `ひらく/ひらける`. Now this is partly because they are actually interchangeable in many cases and on the whole if it's not a case where it really needs to be `ひらく/ひらける`,  
people will generally read `あく/あける` (Về cơ bản thì hai cặp này interchangable)

So first let's take the top two, `あく・あける`. `あく` is self-move. `あくる` is other-move. They both mean `open`. So, `あく`: a door opens, a bottle opens; `あける`: open a door, open a bottle.

### 開く (ひらく & あく)
The difference between `あく` and `ひらく`.
- They both mean `open`. `あく` is officially speaking self-move, although we can see that there's a little bit of leeway here; `ひらく` is both self-move and other-move quite formally.
- The difference between them has nothing to do with self-move or other-move. It has to do with the kind of opening that we're talking about. So if we talk about opening a bottle, taking the lid off a box, anything like that, it's definitely `あける`. On the other hand, if we talk about a flower opening it's definitely `ひらく`.
=> So something that unfolds, opens out, is `ひらく`. Something that simply becomes open instead of closed is `あく・あける`.

Now, there are various areas where these two are interchangeable, but even when they're interchangeable they stress one aspect rather than another.
And just a side note here: with an umbrella, which also spreads out and you might be inclined to say `ひらく`, we don't usually use that, it's generally `さす` for opening an umbrella.

## 開ける

Now, what about `ひらける`? The Japanese grammarians, or at least many of them, actually designate `ひらける` as the self-move version of `ひらく`.

The same with `ひらける` (Na ná trường hợp của `分かる`). So it's used in cases like, for example, we often say `運が開ける`, which means `one's luck opens`. Now, we could say `運が開く`, and that would mean `one's luck unfolds like a flower, becomes open`, but `ひらける` implies not just unfolding but continuing to exist in that state of unfolded-ness.

The reason we would be more prone to say `店をひらく` is partly because it's more other-move than `ひらける` and we're actually doing it to the shop, we're opening it; also because stress is on this act of opening the shop.
