A `まま` is a thing; it's a noun. A “まま” is an unchanged condition.
We can say “自然のままの森” – that’s “a forest in its natural (unchanged) state”.

Một điều mà ta có thể làm với “まま” là ta có thể bỏ “で”. VD: “そのまま食べられる?”

There’s a use of “まま” that you’ll probably come across quite often, and that is “思いのまま” or “心のまま”. And what this means is “in the unchanged condition that’s in our thoughts” or “...in our hearts”.

And they said “思いのままに動けない” – “we are unable to move in the unchanged condition of our thoughts”
