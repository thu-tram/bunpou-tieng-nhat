### てある・ている
What about `-てある`? `ある` also means `be`, so the meaning is in fact very similar. **It also means to be-in-a-state of that verb.** Chúng ta sẽ lấy hai câu ví dụ: `窓が開い**ている**` và `窓が開け**てある**`.

Ở ví dụ đầu tiên, cái `窓が開いている` có nghĩa là cửa sổ đang mở, đúng theo nghĩa đen luôn, đang tồn tại ở trạng thái mở -> So 開く (the one up) means be open yourself, whatever you are, a box or whatever; 開ける (the one down) means open the box, open the door etc.

Nhưng còn `窓が開け**てある**` (we are using the other-move version of `開く`, which is `開ける` _(bottom one)_) -> it was open because somebody else opened it: 
- Dùng dạng tha động từ (other-move) của động từ
- Dùng ある thay vì いる.

Cái đầu tiên để chỉ là "bản thân nó mở" (the window was open – we're not implying that anybody opened the window). Còn cái thứ hai thì không, nhưng **the window is doing the action, which is `ある`: the window is existing in a state of having been opened by somebody else.**

### ておく
**`-ておく` means to put the action in place.**

**So you're `placing` the action, you're putting it into place, you're setting it up.** And **that's why it tends to have the secondary meaning of `do in advance` or `do for another purpose`, because you are setting up that action and the implication is that you want the effect of that action to `remain in place` for whatever future purposes it may have.**

窓を開けておく – open a window so that it will stand open for the future, so that it will then be open, put into place the action of opening the window

**The `-ておく` here doesn't mean do it for a purpose, it doesn't mean do it in advance.** **It means do the action and leave its results in place/put the action in place and leave it in effect.** Similarly, people say, `It's all right to leave a baby to cry sometimes` – `泣かせ**ておく**`
