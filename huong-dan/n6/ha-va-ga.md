### Bài 60
Nói về sự lựa chọn? giữa は、が.

Trước hết cần phân định rõ ràng khi nào dùng topic marker, còn khi nào dùng linchpin:
- **So a topic-marker can only mark old information.** And this is important because old information is unimportant information. New information is what you are actually trying to convey to someone.
- Linchpin
Now, in this sentence, `I` is the subject and the topic. If we choose to stress `I` as the topic and say `私**は**本を買った`, **we're making `私` into the old information, the buying of the book into the new information, and because of this, は has a distinguishing function.** **we're making `私` into the old information, the buying of the book into the new information, and because of this, は has a distinguishing function.** Một cách giải thích dễ hiểu hơn là (Now *the focus is more on the topic* of "as for me", well - what about it? What happened? A book was bought, by me, that's what happened.)

Now, if you say `私が本を買った`, you've changed the emphasis. **You've reversed the emphasis.** The old information is now the buying of the book and **the new information is `I`.** So under what circumstances do you say that? Well, suppose people are looking at an empty space in the bookshelf and wondering what happened, and you say `私が本を買った` – `I'm the one who bought the book.` We all know that the book's gone, we know something happened to the book, now I'm giving you the new information: **`I` am the one who bought the book.** (Đại khái là, ý đang cung cấp thông tin về cuốn sách, đã có người mua, và người đó là "tôi" - đó chính là thông tin mới)

Tóm lại là: So while `私は本を買った` is implicitly the answer to the question `What did you do?`, `私が本を買った` is implicitly the answer to `Who bought the book?` (Hãy nhớ lại về chức năng của Trợ từ](Trợ%20từ.md) ([Trợ từ が)

We know in this case that the natural, neutral way of saying `I bought a book` without emphasizing anything is just to say `本をかった`
So if we say `私は` or `私が`, **we're specifically making a point here.** **We're adding something to the neutral statement that I bought a book.**

Một ví dụ khác (Đọc xong lại cảm thấy khó hiểu =)))):
So, for example, if we say `花が綺麗だ`, we're stressing the `花` as the subject and this means `The flower (or these flowers) are pretty`. `Pretty` is important, but the real subject is `these flowers`. These flowers are what is pretty, these are pretty flowers (Nhấn mạnh vào cái CHỦ NGỮ).

If we say `花は綺麗だ`, we are likely to be saying that flowers in general are pretty. We haven't singled out any flowers as the subject; we've made `flowers` the topic, and the important new information is prettiness. **Flowers in themselves are not new.** They're something we've known about for a long time. **The fact that they're pretty is my comment, my assessment of them.** (Nhấn mạnh vào vẻ đẹp của bông hoa ấy!)

Một ví dụ khá gây lúng túng khác là: 雨が降っている - (as for rain) Rain is falling. が makes it into a flat, definitive statement with no arguments allowed. Just an observation of a fact. Rain is falling. It's raining. The end.

**Similarly, が can mark new material as well as old material,  but は can't mark new material.** **は can mark specific things as well as generalities but が can't really mark generalities.**

Ví dụ khá thực tế: `おまえみたいな半人前に休みはない`. 
So, what it's saying here is `休みは _(zeroが)_ ない` -- `As for rests, _(they)_ don't exist`: `For trainees like you, as for rests, _(they)_ don't exist.` (**Because when you make something a topic, even if it's a kind of sub-topic like this,** **you're throwing the emphasis forward onto what follows it.** You're making the thing that follows it the salient, the important information of the sentence. Nhấn mạnh cái phần sau của câu, cái `ない`)

Một ví dụ khác:
「すごかった！」 「**何が**すごかったの？」 「とにかくすごかったの！」
(Nhìn vào câu số hai, nó sẽ không nói là 何は mà lại là 何が, để nhấn mạnh cái 何, dù mình chưa nghe ai nói 何は trong kiểu câu như này bao giờ ;-;)
(Tạm hiểu, sẽ đọc thêm sau)
