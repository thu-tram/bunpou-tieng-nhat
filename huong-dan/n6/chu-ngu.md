### The `Null-Subject`

**Some languages are termed `null-subject languages` in linguistics, which doesn't really mean they haven't got subjects, it means that their subjects aren't always visible, which is exactly what we have in Japanese.**

### indeterminate subject
**Now, there are cases where we have an indeterminate subject**, and some people might try to argue that these at least are our mystical subjectless Japanese sentences. **But actually they're no different from their English equivalents.**

So we might say `_(zeroが)_ 晴れそうだ`, which means `_(_**it**_)_ looks like being fine`.

**We can't see it, we can't hear it, but we know for a fact that it's there, because without it `だ` makes no sense at all.**
